# R&D Questionnaire - Frank Lee submission

This repo contains the solution to the second part of the questionnaire.

As a preliminary step, make sure that all the dependencies are installed:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This will install jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup, requests, and other dependencies.

There are two ways to view the solution. Both ways contain substantially
the same code.

### 1. Execute the Python script ###

In the terminal navigate to this repo and execute:

`python3 questionnaire.py`

NOTE: this code has only been tested for python3.

### 2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook ###

In the same folder as the repo, if can view the notebook by starting Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

Your web browser should automatically launch and take you to the notebook's page,
but if it does not, follow the link in your terminal screen.

In the browser's Jupyter window, click on "questionnaire.ipynb".

Finally, hit the "Run" button on the top until you can view the average salary.

You should see something like:
